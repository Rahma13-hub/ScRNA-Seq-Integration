#  Integrated scRNA-seq Analysis of Hepatoblastoma: Tumor, Background, and PDX

This project contains a full analysis workflow for scRNA-seq data using Seurat, including integration, clustering, differential expression (DE) analysis, visualization, and GO enrichment.

## 1. Scripts
- [Integration & Clustring](scripts/Integrate_ScRNA-Seq)
- [Visualization Plots](scripts/visualization_plots)

## 2. Data Integration & Clustering
- Samples (Patients + Types) were integrated using Seuratâ€™s integration pipeline.  
- Batch effect (patient effect) was regressed out.  
- UMAP visualization of clusters and sample grouping.  

 Example:

## 2. Marker Gene Visualization
- FeaturePlot and ViolinPlot were used for selected marker genes (CYP2B6, PZP, POU5F1, AFP, ALB).  
- DotPlot was generated to compare reference markers across clusters.  

 Examples:

## 3. Differential Expression (DE) Analysis
Main pairwise comparisons:
- Tumor vs Background  
- Tumor vs PDX  
- PDX vs Background  

For each comparison:
- DE was performed using FindMarkers (Wilcoxon test, patient effect controlled).  
- Results saved as CSV files (DE_<comparison>.csv).  

 Example Volcano plots:

![Volcano Tumor vs PDX](results/volcano/Volcano_tumor_vs_PDX.png)  
![Volcano PDX vs Background](results/volcano/Volcano_PDX_vs_background.png)

## 4. Heatmaps of Top DE Genes
- Selected Top 20 DE genes (based on |log2FC|) for each comparison.  
- Heatmaps generated with sample annotation by Type.  

 Example:

## 5. GO Enrichment Analysis (Biological Processes)
- Performed separately for Upregulated and Downregulated genes.  
- Enrichment done with clusterProfiler::enrichGO.  

Outputs include:
- DotPlot PDFs (GO_<comp>_Up_dotplot.pdf, GO_<comp>_Down_dotplot.pdf)  
- CSV files with enrichment results (GO_<comp>_Up_enrichment.csv)
